### Solar Data Discovery - WEEK 0

MoonLight Energy Solutions aims to develop a strategic approach to significantly enhance its operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. As an Analytics Engineer at MoonLight Energy Solutions, your task is to perform a quick analysis of an environmental measurement provided by the engineering team and translate your observation as a strategy report. Your analysis should focus on identifying key trends and learn valuable insights that will support your data-driven case - your recommendation based on the statistical analysis and EDA.  In particular, your analysis and recommendation must present a strategy focusing on identifying high-potential regions for solar installation that align with the company's long-term sustainability goals. Your report should provide an insight to help realize the overarching objectives of MoonLight Energy Solutions.
